      <h1 class="display-3 mb-3">Gender Guesser v0.1b</h1>
      <p>My first machine learning project: Gender guessing model trained on lots of
        bengali names. Billions and billions of names. Huge dataset. onek accurate, trust me. The name and gender
        dataset was scraped from <b>[censored for legal reasons]. </b> This assumed gender to be binary. Hope i don't
        offend anyone.

            <h3>Word-wise model</h3>
            <p>This model is a machine learning classifer trained on 21,678 single word names which were extracted from
              full names. Each name was assigned its gender based on the full name it comes from.</p>
            <p>
              First the input name is divided into words and passed into the model. The model outputs the
              detected gender of the word and also how confident it is. The final verdict is calculated letting the
              gender values and confidences cancel each other out. For example, a name with two words where one word is
              low confidence male and the other is medium confidence female will be considered female.

            <h3>Full name model</h3>
            <p>This model is a machine learning model trained on 5,44,838 bengali names. This model will work best with
              full names but does also work with single words. Currently it removes all special characters like "." or
              "-".</p>
            <p>
              The full name model is better at identifying the effect of words on entire name. For example, "rahman" is
              evidently present in both female and male names. The word-wise model sets its gender as male or female
              based on its frequency. So during calculation "rahman" affects the final outcome equally as other words in
              the name. On the other hand this model will let the other words in the name affect the final verdict more
              than this word since its not conclusive evidence.
